# EccentricPNwaveform

The following project was done using these codes: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08811

OBJECTIVE
To study the convergence of post-Newtonian gravitational waveforms (as a bivariate series) from eccentric black-hole binaries

CODES
The codes to compute Fisher matrix errors and mismatch are in the respective folders. You will need to change the line "LaunchKernels[12]; " to "LaunchKernels[n]; " where n is the number of cores/processors you want to devote to computing.

Please don't use 'Save link as' to download the codes (they don't download correctly). Instead do 'Clone or Download'>>'Download Zip'.
